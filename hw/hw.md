# Hardware

The NervesKey is a tiny circuit board with an ATECC608A cryptographic chip from
Microchip Technology. It is an inexpensive addition to the Raspberry Pi and
other embedded computing platforms that include an I2C bus.

The production NervesKey board contains the tiny 'UDFN' version of the part
[ATECC608A-MAHDA](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/ATECC608A-MAHDA-S/ATECC608A-MAHDA-STR-ND/7928113)
and a 0.1uF 0402 size capacitor.  These boards are not easy assembled, so they
are professionally manufactured in high quantity for the Nerves project and
offered for sale in low quantity by Nerves contributor [Troodon Software,
LLC](http://www.troodon-software.com/).

## Mounting to a Raspberry Pi

The easiest way to outfit a Raspberry Pi with a NervesKey is to solder it to the
'hat' expansion header on the bottom of the board as shown below.  This will
connect the appropriate signals and keep the board out of the way of other uses
of the hat header.  The NervesKey board is thin to support this application.
